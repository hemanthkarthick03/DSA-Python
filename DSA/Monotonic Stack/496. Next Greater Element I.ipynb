    "# [496. Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **next greater element**  of some element <code>x</code> in an array is the **first greater**  element that is **to the right**  of <code>x</code> in the same array.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two **distinct 0-indexed**  integer arrays <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code>, where <code>nums1</code> is a subset of <code>nums2</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each <code>0 <= i < nums1.length</code>, find the index <code>j</code> such that <code>nums1[i] == nums2[j]</code> and determine the **next greater element**  of <code>nums2[j]</code> in <code>nums2</code>. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is <code>-1</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an array <code>ans</code> of length <code>nums1.length</code> such that <code>ans[i]</code> is the **next greater element**  as described above.\n",

    "**Example 1:** \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]\n",
    "Output: [-1,3,-1]\n",
    "Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:\n",
    "- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.\n",
    "- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.\n",
    "- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:** \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    "Output: [3,-1]\n",
    "Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:\n",
    "- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.\n",
    "- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000</code>\n",
    "- <code>0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^4</code>\n",
    "- All integers in <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code> are **unique** .\n",
    "- All the integers of <code>nums1</code> also appear in <code>nums2</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Follow up:**  Could you find an <code>O(nums1.length + nums2.length)</code> solution?"
